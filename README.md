# Data-Cleaning-
This project provides a step-by-step guide on how to clean data stored in CSV format using MySQL Workbench. Cleaning data is crucial for ensuring accuracy and reliability in data analysis. The cleaning process consists of four basic steps:

1. Removing Duplicates
2. Standardizing the Data
3. Removing NULL or Blank Values
4. Removing Irrelevant Columns

The dataset used was obtained from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv
